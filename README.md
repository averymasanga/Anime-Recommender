# Anime-Recommender
Get recommended 5 anime that is close to the show you input
  
Using Python, I created a simple program that asks the user for the title of an anime they want recommendations for and the output will give the user 5 of the most closely related anime that along with its genre, a description of the show, the studio that made the show, the date it aired, and the rating the show earned. The anime data is from a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle that was scraped from an anime database website. The user's Kaggle page the I got the CCSV from is linked below.
